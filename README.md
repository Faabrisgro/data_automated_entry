# Automated Data Entry in Google Sheets with Google App Scripts 

At the request of a client, I developed a system for tracking the inventory of mobile devices and accessories using Google Apps Scripts and Google Sheets.

Through the use of buttons, the end user can input data automatically and also record daily operations. 

This was a client requirement, and we fulfilled it exactly as requested, respecting their decisions even though we had recommended better data management practices.
